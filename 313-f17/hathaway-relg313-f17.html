<h2 id="org39ea636">Course Description</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org39ea636">
<p>
<i>The following syllabus is subject to change. Any modifications will be communicated clearly to the students and posted on  <b>Blackboard</b> and on the instructor's web page</i>.
</p>

<p>
An introduction to the various methods and interpretive approaches used to read and appreciate the texts of Ancient Israel and early Christianity that have been canonized as the Bible.
</p>

<p>
The academic study of the bible in public universities is not the same as bible study in a faith community. The foundation for our study is what the text originally meant in the light of the Near Eastern setting out of which the text emerged. Our goal is to learn to think carefully and critically about what it originally meant.
</p>


<p>
As an <b>introduction,</b> this course will provide a variety of tools to enable the student to appreciate and to read with insight the <b>Hebrew Scriptures</b>. As it is about the Hebrew Scriptures (the Christian <b>Old Testament</b>) it will emphasize the reading of the text through a variety of lenses that will include but not be limited to the more familiar Christian (New Testament) lens. 
</p>

<p>
The course intends to help the students gain a general familiarity with the contents of the Hebrew Scriptures which span an enormous time frame and include a wide variety of different genre. The course will provide basic tools for interpreting the text and a framework for developing more sophisticated abilities in interpretation.

You must have a <b>Study Bible</b> available to you during each  class. A study bible has additional critical material to assist in reading the bible. These include: annotations, cross-references, concordance, maps, articles, etc. The <i>New Interpreter's Study Bible</i> is among the best single volume study bibles available. The instructor will also make use of <i>The Jewish Bible</i> during the course of the class. There  are several that are available digitally, including:

<dt>Examinations (2 including the final)</dt><dd>The exams will cover the readings, and the topics covered in class. The final will be cumulative.</dd>
<dt>Homework assignments and quizzes</dt><dd>will be given at unscheduled times without advanced notice. They may not be made up.</dd>
<dt>Class participation</dt><dd>Each student is expected to complete the week's readings ahead of class and to participate actively in activities and discussions.</dd>
<dt>Journals</dt><dd>On a regular basis the student will reflect on the readings by submitting responses to a Google Form®.  A part of the assignment for the reflection is to be present for the discussion on the topic. The rubric for the journals is as follows:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>An A reflection</b> will demonstrate an awareness of the complexities of the assigned reading, making connections with the students' own experience and prior education. It will generally be between 250 &amp; 350 words in length. A response is given to all of the prompts. The student is present for the following class and contributes to the discussion about the reading.</li>
<li><b>A B reflection</b> will demonstrate that the student read the material with accuracy and with some insight, but not making deeper connections. Perhaps not all the questions were answered. The student may not have contributed to the discussion in class.</li>
<li><b>A C reflection</b> gives a cursory, if accurate, response to the readings. The student responded to the journal but was absent from class for the discussion.</li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>Papers</dt><dd>There will be three (3) reflection papers. They will be relatively short papers responding to a prompt given by the instructor. A paper turned in within 24 hours of the due date will lose one letter grade. If a paper is turned in more than 24 hours after the due date, it will not be graded.</dd>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc5ff949">
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Attendance</dt><dd>University policy states that you will not receive credit for the course if you miss more than 25% of the class. This class has a stricter requirement. For this class, any classes missed beyond five (5) will reduce your grade. Please note that there are no automatically excused absences. The student is responsible for contacting the instructor in case of sickness, emergencies, sports travel and other engagements that require an absence. Note also that it is the student's responsibility to make up for any missed work due to absences. Of course missed conversations and presentations are nearly impossible to make up so it is important to keep absences to a minimum.  If you have a difficulty that might lead to excessive absence, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible.</dd>

<dt>Exams</dt><dd>During the course of normal exams no one will be allowed to leave the room. Anyone who does choose to leave will turn in their exam and will not be allowed to resume.</dd>

<dt>Excused absences</dt><dd>Please note that there are no automatically excused absences. The student is responsible for contacting the instructor in case of sickness, emergencies, sports travel and other engagements that require an absence. Note also that it is the student's responsibility to make up for any missed work due to absences. Of course missed conversations and presentations are nearly impossible to make up so it is important to keep absences to a minimum.  If you have a difficulty that might lead to excessive absence, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible.</dd>
<dt>Makeups</dt><dd>There will be no makeup for the occasional quizzes and assignments.</dd>
</dl>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Regardless of absence or lateness</dt><dd>You are responsible for all course material and requirements.</dd>
<dt>Tardiness</dt><dd>Three tardies count as one absence.</dd>
<dt>Expectation of respect</dt><dd>Regardless of sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, religion, age and ability, you will be treated and respected as a human being. Your continued presence in this course signals your commitment to act likewise toward your peers and your instructors.</dd>
<dt>Expectation of integrity</dt><dd>Students are expected to cultivate personal and academic integrity. Review the student code of conduct for university polices on academic misconduct. Academic misconduct will not be tolerated and will result in a failing grade on the assignment and/or in the course. The full handbook is available online at: <a href="http://www2.winthrop.edu/studentaffairs/handbook/StudentHandbook.pdf">http://www2.winthrop.edu/studentaffairs/handbook/StudentHandbook.pdf</a>.</dd>
<dt>Academic misconduct</dt><dd>As noted in the Student Conduct Code: "Responsibility for good conduct rests with students as adult individuals." The policy on student academic misconduct is outlined in the "Student Conduct Code Academic Misconduct Policy" in the online Student Handbook which can be accessed at<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>
<a href="http://www.winthrop.edu/uploadedFiles/studentconduct/StudentHandbook.pdf">http://www.winthrop.edu/uploadedFiles/studentconduct/StudentHandbook.pdf</a>. <br />
Dishonesty is a serious offense in all its forms, whether lying about reasons for an absence or missed assignment or cheating on a test or misrepresenting borrowed material as your own. It can result in a failing grade on a test, assignment, or the course, or even dismissal from the university. 
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Plagiarism</dt><dd>Plagiarism is the use of someone else’s thoughts, words, ideas, or lines of argument in your own work without appropriate documentation (a parenthetical citation at the end and a listing in "Works Cited")–whether you use that material in a quotation, paraphrase, or summary. It is a theft of intellectual property and will not be tolerated, whether intentional or not. It is also a violation of the Student Conduct Code (<a href="http://www.winthrop.edu/studentaffairs/Judicial/judcode.htm">http://www.winthrop.edu/studentaffairs/Judicial/judcode.htm</a>). Plagiarism will result in failure on that assignment. Especially serious cases or second offences can result in failure in the course.</dd>
<dt>Cell phones</dt><dd>Cell phones normally have no use in this class and when they are being used in class they reflect disrespect for students  and instructors &#x2013; a violation of the point above about our <b>expectation of respect</b>. <b>Phones  should be on silent and kept in your book bag or purse throughout class time unless otherwise instructed</b>. Except with permission, texting or responding to email will result in a "0" for participation for the day. If a cell phone is in evidence  during class hours,  the owner of the phone will be marked absent for the day. There may or may not be a warning. If it is a quiz day, their quiz will be marked 0 (zero). If a student responds to text messages or email during class they will receive a "0" for the day's participation.<br /></dd>

<dt>Computers and other devices</dt><dd>There are clear uses for computers in the classroom, including; taking notes, reading digital textbooks, looking for reference information, etc. Equally clearly, computers provide easy distraction from the responsibilities we all bring to the classroom, including; checking email, browsing on Facebook®, etc., etc. These devices are allowed in my classroom, but any evidence of using them for anything other than clear classroom work will result in an assignment of "0" for the day's participation grade.</dd>

<dt>Appeals</dt><dd>I know that I do make mistakes and overlook things that I shouldn't. It's probably true of some of you as well. If you don't understand a grade or comment, please ask me. If you think that a grade is in error and you would like it corrected, you must put your request and justification in writing. Under no circumstances will a grade be lowered because clarification was requested. No grades will be changed, however, without documentation.</dd>

<h3 id="orgac66eeb">Participation and Engagement</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgac66eeb">
<p>
Participation and engagement are essential elements in the RELG 101 classroom.  You should seek to demonstrate your intellectual curiosity through demonstrated knowledge of the reading assignments, thoughtful reflection of the topics, contribution of insightful ideas and consideration of your classmates’ perspectives. Consider the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do you arrive at class on time, each class period, with a positive, open attitude?</li>
<li>Did you critically read the material? Are there markings, highlights, and questions written in your book?  Have you completed your reading journals?</li>
<li>Have you thoughtfully considered the readings prior to arriving in class?</li>
<li>Can you answer questions about the current readings and connect these ideas with previous readings in the class?</li>
<li>Do you ask good questions? Do you listen to your peers?</li>
<li>Are your questions and comments deep and related to the reading, or shallow and random?</li>
<li><p>
Are you willing to challenge your thoughts and opinions and those of others in a respectful, open manner?  Are you willing to consider “what if I am wrong?”
</p>

<p>
Disagreement is a basic element of a democratic society.  Diverse perspectives are appreciated and encouraged.  You are expected to show respect to your instructor and your peers.  Students should work to create a classroom community where all perspectives are heard and appreciated.  This classroom is a safe environment in which regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, natural origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, political beliefs, age, or ability, you will be treated with respect.
