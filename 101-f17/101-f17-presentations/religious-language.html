<h2 id="orgf2caadd">Religious language</h2>
<p>
Most often <b>poetic</b> in the sense that, like poetry, it <b>seeks to use ordinary words to convey extraordinary meanings</b>.
</p>



<p class="fragment (appear)">
The nature of the sacred as <b>being set apart</b> can be expressed in <b>paradoxical like language</b>. Examples of 
</p>

<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">John of the cross</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Hindu Mystics</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Thomas Aquinas.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Other sorts of language like father mother Lord King are more like poetry than they are say a grocery list.</li>

<h3 id="org610d5c0">Religious Myth:</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">A story that <b>sets up a world by describing ultimate reality and its relationship to humanity</b>.  Myths seek to explain the ultimate meaning of the universe (cosmos) and our existence, its ultimate origins, destiny, order (or disorder) and relationships.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Purpose = <b>revelation of the nature of the sacred</b>, the universe, and human nature.  In short, “How does reality makes sense in light of the sacred?"</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org011324e">
<h3 id="org011324e">Religious Myth (cont)</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Myths seek to <b>narrate or reveal a transcendent reality</b> and its relation to ordinary reality.  Mythic time transcends ordinary time.  Mythic events transcend “empirically observable" events.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">They <b>do not seek to record simply what happened</b> in ordinary reality.  They do not aim at empirical or scientific truth (that can be tested via experiments).</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Rather myths <b>represent the collective experience and wisdom of a community over time</b> concerning the deepest meaning of reality and the ultimate frame of reference for understanding it expressed in the most powerful and fundamental forms of human language—stories conveyed via imaginative, poetic language (exaggeration = frequent vehicle because ordinary language inadequate).  A myth is like a pair of glasses or framework through which people “image" or see the world.
<ul>
<li>Note Well: For one who believes that there is no ultimate meaning to our world, no transcendent reality, or that there is only our immediate experience as known empirically, myths are false or do not exist.</li>

</ul></li>

<section id="slide-org4dc5e07">
<h2 id="org4dc5e07">Parable:</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">A story that <b>upsets an existing world or turns it upside down</b>; makes a point by violating our expectations and calling into questions our assumptions.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">It seeks to shock the hearer into seeing ordinary things in a new way, i.e., in light of the sacred reality which is totally “other" than the ordinary and customary.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">A parable seeks to move people into a deeper engagement with sacred reality.</li>
<li class="fragment appear"><b>Sacred figures often perform “parabolic actions"</b> or actions that upset the way things are and open our eyes to a new reality.</li>

</ul>




</section>
<section id="slide-org07465c6">
<h3 id="org07465c6">Examples of Parables/Parabolic Actions</h3>
<ul>

<li class="fragment appear">A seeker to the Buddha "Are you a god or a magician?"</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Buddha: "I am not a god or a magician.  I am awake."</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Awake seems ordinary but it is not.  Greatness can't lie in it.</li>

</ul>


<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Jesus seeks to open people's eyes to the kingdom of God when he reads from <b>Isaiah 61:1-2</b> in Luke "The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring glad tidings to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim liberty to captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, and to proclaim a year of favor from Yahweh [a jubilee year]" . . . and a day of vengeance for our God . .  <b>Luke 4:18-19</b></li>

<section id="slide-org8bc39da">
<h3 id="org8bc39da">New Testament Parables</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear"><b>Good Samaritan</b> = like the good Al Qaeda (or ISIS) terrorist. Our social status does not determine our holiness; but our compassion—even a compassion that violates social customs re: ritual purity.  That is what God wants.</li>
<li class="fragment appear"><b>Matthew 25</b>: Whenever you did it to the least of my brothers and sisters you did it to me—Christ is encountered in the needy.</li>
<li class="fragment appear"><b>Prodigal Son</b> (Who is lost, the younger or the older son?) or Workers in the Vineyard—those who worked a little get paid the same as those who worked a lot; or Unforgiving debtor. (<b>Luke 15-16</b>)</li>

<h2 id="org4fd0266">4 functions of Sacred Stories (including scriptures):</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Connect with the sacred dimension of existence</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Order the cosmos, provide coherence for the believer</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Give shape to memory and sustains a tradition</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Believers measure behavior style of life Etc</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Connect us to the sacred</b>: reveal the sacred and provide a vehicle for (or mediate) encounter with the sacred through the imaginative experience and ritual re-enacting of the story; reveal a path to the sacred (e.g. Buddha's journey to enlightenment); provide insight/wisdom re: ultimate truth.</li>
<li><b>Order the cosmos</b>: give an account of the nature, purpose, order, and destiny of the universe, explain how things are related, where things belong, what they mean, how it all fits together ultimately; relate the transcendent reality to the ordinary reality.</li>

<li><b>Traditio</b>: "hand over" a way of life, worldview, set of practices, values, and stories that constitute a community over time from one generation to the next.  Remember truth handed on from the past and bring it to life in the present by helping people to apply it and live it out today.  Continue a way of life and teach it to the next generation.  Tradition—an extended conversation about the meaning of life of a community over time.</li>
<li><b>Convey an Ethic</b>: present patterns, models (saints, prophets), and standards of behavior for living in harmony with the sacred order.  E.g. Sunna = the beaten path of the prophet Mohammed.</li>
