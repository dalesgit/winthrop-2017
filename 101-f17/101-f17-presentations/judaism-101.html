<h2 id="org0b04daf">What is Judaism?</h2>
<p class="fragment (appear)">
Judaism has been described as a religion, a race, a culture, and a nation 
All of these descriptions have some validity 
The Jewish people are perhaps best described as an <b>extended family</b> 
</p>


<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note:
What is Judaism? What does it mean to be a Jew? Most people, both Jewish and gentile, would instinctively say that Judaism is a religion. And yet, there are militant atheists who insist that they are Jews! Is Judaism a race? If you were to say so, most Jews would think you were an antisemite! So what is Judaism?
Is Judaism a Religion?
</p>

<p>
Clearly, there is a religion called Judaism, a set of ideas about the world and the way we should live our lives that is called "Judaism." It is studied in Religious Studies courses and taught to Jewish children in Hebrew schools. See What do Jews Believe? for details. There is a lot of flexibility about certain aspects of those beliefs, and a lot of disagreement about specifics, but that flexibility is built into the organized system of belief that is Judaism.
</p>

<p>
However, many people who call themselves Jews do not believe in that religion at all! More than half of all Jews in Israel today call themselves "secular," and don't believe in G-d or any of the religious beliefs of Judaism. Half of all Jews in the United States don't belong to any synagogue. They may practice some of the rituals of Judaism and celebrate some of the holidays, but they don't think of these actions as religious activities.
</p>

<p>
The most traditional Jews and the most liberal Jews and everyone in between would agree that these secular people are still Jews, regardless of their disbelief. See Who is a Jew? Clearly, then, there is more to being Jewish than just a religion.

<section id="slide-org697ea9c">
<h3 id="org697ea9c">Are Jews a Race?</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">In the 1980s, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Jews are a race, at least for purposes of certain anti-discrimination laws.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Many Jews were deeply offended</li>
<li class="fragment appear">it calls to mind the reasonings of Nazi Germany</li>

</ul>

<p class="fragment (appear)">
Their reasoning: at the time these laws were passed, people routinely spoke of the "Jewish race" or the "Italian race" as well as the "Negro race," so that is what the legislators intended to protect.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note:
But many Jews were deeply offended by that decision, offended by any hint that Jews could be considered a race. The idea of Jews as a race brings to mind nightmarish visions of Nazi Germany, where Jews were declared to be not just a race, but an inferior race that had to be rounded up into ghettos and exterminated like vermin.
</p>

<p>
But setting aside the emotional issues, Jews are clearly not a race.
</p>

<p>
Race is a genetic distinction, and refers to people with shared ancestry and shared genetic traits. You can't change your race; it's in your DNA. I could never become black or Asian no matter how much I might want to.
</p>

<p>
Common ancestry is not required to be a Jew. Many Jews worldwide share common ancestry, as shown by genetic research; however, you can be a Jew without sharing this common ancestry, for example, by converting. Thus, although I could never become black or Asian, blacks and Asians have become Jews (Sammy Davis Jr. and Connie Chung).

<section id="slide-orgaf4ddf0">
<h3 id="orgaf4ddf0">Is It a Culture or Ethnic Group?</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Most secular American Jews think of their Jewishness as a matter of <b>culture or ethnicity</b>.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">When they think of Jewish culture, they think of the <b>food</b>, of the <b>Yiddish language</b>, of some limited holiday observances, and of cultural values like the emphasis on education.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Much of this is in fact just one kind of Jewish culture (<i>Ashkenazi vs. Sephardic</i>)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note:
Those secular American Jews would probably be surprised to learn that much of what they think of as Jewish culture is really just Ashkenazic Jewish culture, the culture of Jews whose ancestors come from one part of the world. Jews have lived in many parts of the world and have developed many different traditions. As a Sephardic friend likes to remind me, Yiddish is not part of his culture, nor are bagels and lox, chopped liver, latkes, gefilte fish or matzah ball soup. His idea of Jewish cooking includes bourekas, phyllo dough pastries filled with cheese or spinach. His ancestors probably wouldn't know what to do with a dreidel.
</p>

<p>
There are certainly cultural traits and behaviors that are shared by many Jews, that make us feel more comfortable with other Jews. Jews in many parts of the world share many of those cultural aspects. However, that culture is not shared by all Jews all over the world, and people who do not share that culture are no less Jews because of it. Thus, Judaism must be something more than a culture or an ethnic group.

<h3 id="org22eef44">Are the Jews a Nation?</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">The traditional explanation, and the one given in the Torah, is that the Jews are a nation.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">The Hebrew word is "goy."</li>
<li class="fragment appear">The Torah and the rabbis used this term not in the modern sense meaning a territorial and political entity, but in the ancient sense meaning a group of people with a common history, a common destiny, and a sense that we are all connected to each other.</li>

</ul>


<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note:
The traditional explanation, and the one given in the Torah, is that the Jews are a nation. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hebrew word, believe it or not, is "goy." The Torah and the rabbis used this term not in the modern sense meaning a territorial and political entity, but in the ancient sense meaning a group of people with a common history, a common destiny, and a sense that we are all connected to each other.</li>

</ul>


<p>
Unfortunately, in modern times, the term "nation" has become too contaminated by ugly, jingoistic notions of a country obsessed with its own superiority and bent on world domination. Because of this notion of "nationhood," Jews are often falsely accused of being disloyal to their own country in favor of their loyalty to the Jewish "nation," of being more loyal to Israel than to their home country. Some have gone so far as to use this distorted interpretation of "nationhood" to prove that Jews do, or seek to, control the world. In fact, a surprising number of antisemitic websites and newsgroup postings linked to this page (in an earlier form) as proof of their antisemitic delusions that Jews are nationalistic, that Israel is a colonial power and so forth.
</p>

<p>
Because of the inaccurate connotations that have attached themselves to the term "nation," the term can no longer be used to accurately describe the Jewish people.

<section id="slide-org4ecfbf9">
<h3 id="org4ecfbf9">The Jewish People are a Family</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Judaism as "religion", "race", or "ethnic group" each has merit, <b>but each is inadequate</b></li>
<li class="fragment appear">Jews are connected to other Jews throughout the world and throughout time</li>
<li class="fragment appear">some have suggested the best metaphor is "family"</li>

</ul>


<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note:
It is clear from the discussion above that there is a certain amount of truth in the claims that it is a religion, a race, or an ethnic group, none of these descriptions is entirely adequate to describe what connects Jews to other Jews. And yet, almost all Jews feel a sense of connectedness to each other that many find hard to explain, define, or even understand. Traditionally, this interconnectedness was understood as "nationhood" or "peoplehood," but those terms have become so distorted over time that they are no longer accurate.
</p>


<p>
Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz has suggested a better analogy for the Jewish people: We are a family. See the third essay in his 2005 book, We Jews: Who Are We and What Should We Do. But though this is a relatively new book, it is certainly not a new concept: throughout the Bible and Jewish literature, the Jewish people are referred to as "the Children of Israel," a reference to the fact that we are all the physical or spiritual descendants of the Patriarch Jacob, who was later called Israel. In other words, we are part of his extended family.
</p>

<p>
Like a family, we don't always agree with each other. We often argue and criticize each other. We hold each other to the very highest standards, knowing that the shortcomings of any member of the family will be held against all of us. But when someone outside of the family unfairly criticizes a family member or the family as a whole, we are quick to join together in opposition to that unfair criticism.
</p>

<p>
When members of our "family" suffer or are persecuted, we all feel their pain. For example, in the 1980s, when Africa was suffering from droughts and famines, many Jews around the world learned for the first time about the Beta Israel, the Jews of Ethiopia. Their religion, race and culture are quite different from ours, and we had not even known that they existed before the famine. And yet, our hearts went out to them as our fellow Jews during this period of famine, like distant cousins we had never met, and Jews from around the world helped them to emigrate to Israel.
</p>

<p>
When a member of our "family" does something illegal, immoral or shameful, we all feel the shame, and we all feel that it reflects on us. As Jews, many of us were embarrassed by the scandals of Monica Lewinsky, Jack Abramoff and Bernie Madoff, because they are Jews and their actions reflect on us all, even though we disapprove. The Madoff scandal was all the more embarassing, because so many of his victims were Jews and Jewish charities: a Jew robbing from our own "family"! We were shocked when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzchak Rabin was killed by a Jew, unable to believe that one Jew would ever kill another member of the "family."
</p>

<p>
And when a member of our "family" accomplishes something significant, we all feel proud. A perfect example of Jews (even completely secular ones) delighting in the accomplishments of our fellow Jews is the perennial popularity of Adam Sandler's Chanukkah songs, listing famous people who are Jewish. We all take pride in scientists like Albert Einstein or political leaders like Joe Lieberman (we don't all agree with his politics or his religious views, but we were all proud to see him on a national ticket). And is there a Jew who doesn't know (or at least feel pride upon learning) that Sandy Koufax declined to pitch in a World Series game that fell on Yom Kippur?

</p>

<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">God is the creator of all that exists;</li>

<li class="fragment appear">He is one, incorporeal (without a body), and He alone is to be worshipped as absolute ruler of the universe.</li>

<h3 id="org9c4b887">Scripture</h3>
<p>
Although Christians base much of their faith on the same Hebrew Scriptures as Jews do, there are major differences in belief:  
</p>

<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Jews generally consider <b>actions and behavior to be of primary importance</b>;</li>
<li class="fragment appear">beliefs come out of actions. This conflicts with conservative Christians for whom belief is of primary importance and actions are a result of that belief.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Jewish belief does not accept the Christian concept of <b>original sin</b> (the belief that all people have inherited Adam and Eve's sin when they disobeyed God's instructions in the Garden of Eden).</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Judaism <b>affirms the inherent goodness of the world and its people as creations of God</b>.</li>

Note:
This does not mean that they are in any way to be considered superior to other groups. Bible verses such as Exodus 19:5 simply state that God has selected Israel to receive and study the Torah, to worship God only, to rest on the Sabbath, and to celebrate the festivals. Jews were not chosen to be better than others; they were simply selected to be a light to the Gentiles and to be a blessing to all the nations.

Note:
It is derived from the root Pe-Lamed-Lamed and the word l'hitpalel, meaning to judge oneself. This surprising word origin provides insight into the purpose of Jewish prayer. The most important part of any Jewish prayer, whether it be a prayer of petition, of thanksgiving, of praise of G-d, or of confession, is the introspection it provides, the moment that we spend looking inside ourselves, seeing our role in the universe and our relationship to G-d.

Observant Jews daven (pray) in formal worship services three times a day, every day: at evening (Ma'ariv), in the morning (Shacharit), and in the afternoon (Minchah). Daily prayers are collected in a book called a siddur, which derives from the Hebrew root meaning "order," because the siddur shows the order of prayers. It is the same root as the word seder, which refers to the Passover home service.

<p>
Undoubtedly the oldest fixed daily prayer in Judaism is the <b>Shema</b>. This consists of Deut. 6:4-9, Deut. 11:13-21, and Num. 15:37-41. <a href="http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/705353/jewish/The-Shema.htm">http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/705353/jewish/The-Shema.htm</a>
</p>


<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note:
that the first paragraph commands us to speak of these matters "when you retire and when you arise." From ancient times, this commandment was fulfilled by reciting the Shema twice a day: morning and night.

<h2 id="orge362d2b">Shabbat</h2>
<p>
The Sabbath (or Shabbat, as it is called in Hebrew) is one of the best known and least understood of all Jewish observances. People who do not observe Shabbat think of it as a day filled with stifling restrictions, or as a day of prayer like the Christian Sabbath. But to those who observe Shabbat, it is a precious gift from G-d, a day of great joy eagerly awaited throughout the week, a time when we can set aside all of our weekday concerns and devote ourselves to higher pursuits. 
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note: 
In Jewish literature, poetry and music, Shabbat is described as a bride or queen, as in the popular Shabbat hymn Lecha Dodi Likrat Kallah (come, my beloved, to meet the [Sabbath] bride). It is said "more than Israel has kept Shabbat, Shabbat has kept Israel."
</p>

<p>
Shabbat is the most important ritual observance in Judaism.
