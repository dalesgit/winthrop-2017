"For many years, I have been convinced that the European spirit is on the wane, and is in need of a return to its Asian roots. I have admired Buddha for many years, and have been reading Indian literature since my earliest youth. Later, I became more familiar with Lao Tsu and the other Chinese philosophers“

<section id="slide-org92d29f8">
<h3 id="org92d29f8">1-2</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear"><b>Overcoming the Monster</b> — Stories like Beowulf, ‘Little Red Riding Hood’, Jaws, and many of the James Bond films, where a hero must defeat a monster and restore order to a world that has been threatened by the monster’s presence.</li>
<li class="fragment appear"><b>Rags to Riches</b> — These stories feature modest, generally virtuous but downtrodden characters, who achieve a happy ending when their special talents or true beauty is revealed to the world at large. Includes any number of classics such as ‘Cinderella’, David Copperfield, and the Horatio Alger novels.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-org68e1640">
<h3 id="org68e1640">3-4</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear"><b>The Quest</b> — A hero, often accompanied by sidekicks, travels in search of a priceless treasure and fights against evil and overpowering odds, and ends when he gets both the treasure and the girl. The Odyssey is a classic example of this kind of story.</li>
<li class="fragment appear"><b>Voyage and Return</b> — Alice in Wonderland, Robinson Crusoe on his desert island, other stories of normal protagonists who are suddenly thrust into strange and alien worlds and must make their way back to normal life once more.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-org57ba74c">
<h3 id="org57ba74c">5-7</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear"><b>Comedy</b> — Not always synonymous with humour. Instead, the plot of a comedy involves some kind of confusion that must be resolved before the hero and heroine can be united in love. Think of Shakespeare’s comedies, The Marriage of Figaro, the plays of Oscar Wilde and Gilbert and Sullivan, and even War and Peace.</li>
<li class="fragment appear"><b>Tragedy</b> — As a rule, the terrible consequences of human overreaching and egotism. The Picture of Dorian Gray, Julius Caesar, Anna Karenina…this category is usually self-evident.</li>
<li class="fragment appear"><b>Rebirth</b> — The stories of Ebeneezer Scrooge and Mary Lennox would fall into this basic plot type, which focuses on a threatening shadow that seems nearly victorious until a sequence of fortuitous (or even miraculous) events lead to redemption and rebirth, and the restoration of a happier world.</li>

<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">most authoritative text for Hinduism</li>
<li class="fragment appear">composed between 2300 and 1200 B.C.E.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">e.g. The oldest and most important of these collections contains more than a thousand songs to various gods and goddesses and is aptly named the Rig, meaning praise. Scholars believe it was composed between 2300 and 1200 B.C.E.</li>

Note:
The Veda regarded humans as being individual souls and members of a stratified society. For the Aryans, the essence of human life is the soul, which they associated with the breath, designated by the word tman. The Sanskrit atman has cognates in the English word atmosphere and the German word atmen, which means to breathe.

<h3 id="orgeec0a8d">Classical Hinduism</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Transformations of thought in the Axial Age (c. 800&#x2013;200 B.C.E.) led to the re-evaluation of Vedic ritual and new ideas about the nature of human existence.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Deeper spiritual questions led to the examination of human nature and the possibility of an <b>afterlife</b>.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">(<b>This evolution in Indian religion was roughly contemporaneous with similar developments in other civilizations, including ancient Greece, China, Mesopotamia, and Israel.</b>)</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-org42ecef9">
<h3 id="org42ecef9">From Cosmic to Personal</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">The function of religion changed from that of <b>cosmic maintenance</b> to one of <b>personal enlightenment</b> and transformation.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Classical Hinduism established the central problem of human existence for Hindus; <b>samsara</b>, the cycle of continual <b>transmigrations of the soul</b>.</li>
<li class="fragment appear"><b>Karma</b>, even good <b>karma</b>, keeps a person bound to the cycle of transmigration. One path the Hindu tradition offers for the attainment of <b>moksha</b>, or ultimate release, is the path of wisdom.</li>

<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">The path of wisdom found in the Axial Age, when the most important Hindu responses to the anxieties about death and rebirth were recorded in a collection of texts called the <b>Upanishads</b>. The oldest of the <b>Upanishads</b> was probably composed between 800&#x2013;400 B.C.E., but actually written down much later.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Modern Hinduism has had to face challenges brought by the advent of Islam and Western culture.</li>

</ul>

Both incursions into India have left profound and lasting imprints on Hinduism.
