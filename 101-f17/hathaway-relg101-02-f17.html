<dt>Description</dt><dd>The course provides an examination of the varying concepts of religion and the methods used in studying religious behavior and belief. It  provides an introduction to the religious dimension of human existence, and it  examines various  concepts of religion and the methods used in studying religious behavior and belief. Through a series of selected readings, the class will reflect on and discuss key elements of the academic study of religion. Discussion and various group activities will highlights experiences that point toward the sacred in the world we live in.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
From lectures and a synthesis of reading reflections and discussions the class highlight some of the major questions in the scholarly study of religion. What is religion? How does or should religion relate to morality? What is the relation of religion to culture?
</p>

<p>
The readings will illustrate that there are a wide variety of ways to approach the study of religion. Through discussion and guided exercises we will reflect critically on our own religious tradition in comparison to other traditions. We will identify some of the ways in which different religious traditions impact the world we live in.

<dt>Class participation</dt><dd>Each student is expected to complete the week's readings ahead of class and to participate actively in activities and discussions. Homework assignments will be given at unscheduled times.</dd>
<dt>Weekly quizzes</dt><dd>There will be  unannounced quizzes given in-class. These  may not be made up.</dd>
<dt>Weekly journals</dt><dd>On a regular basis the student will reflect on the readings by submitting responses to a Google Form®.   A sample and directions for this journal will be posted on Blackboard.  The rubric for the journals is as follows:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>An A reflection</b> will demonstrate an awareness of the complexities of the assigned reading, making connections with the students' own experience and prior education.</li>
<li><b>A B reflection</b> will demonstrate that the student read the material with accuracy and with some insight, but not making deeper connections.</li>
<li><b>A C reflection</b> gives a cursory, if accurate, response to the readings.</li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>Examinations (3 and a final)</dt><dd>The  exams will cover the readings, and the topics covered in class.</dd>
<dt>Papers</dt><dd>There will be three (3) reflection papers. They will be relatively short papers responding to a prompt given by the instructor. A paper turned in within 24 hours of the due date will lose one letter grade. If a paper is turned in more than 24 hours after the due date, it will not be graded.</dd>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Attendance</dt><dd>University policy states that you will not receive credit for the course if you miss more than 25% of the class. This class has a stricter requirement. For this class, any classes missed beyond five (5) will reduce your grade. Please note that there are no automatically excused absences. The student is responsible for contacting the instructor in case of sickness, emergencies, sports travel and other engagements that require an absence. Note also that it is the student's responsibility to make up for any missed work due to absences. Of course missed conversations and presentations are nearly impossible to make up so it is important to keep absences to a minimum.  If you have a difficulty that might lead to excessive absence, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible.</dd>
<dt>Exams</dt><dd>During the course of normal exams no one will be allowed to leave the room. Anyone who does choose to leave will turn in their exam and will not be allowed to resume.</dd>

<dt>Excused absences</dt><dd>Please note that there are no automatically excused absences. The student is responsible for contacting the instructor in case of sickness, emergencies, sports travel and other engagements that require an absence. Note also that it is the student's responsibility to make up for any missed work due to absences. Of course missed conversations and presentations are nearly impossible to make up so it is important to keep absences to a minimum.  If you have a difficulty that might lead to excessive absence, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible.</dd>
<dt>Makeups</dt><dd>There will be no makeup for the occasional quizzes.</dd>
</dl>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Regardless of absence or lateness</dt><dd>You are responsible for all course material and requirements.</dd>
<dt>Tardiness</dt><dd>Three tardies count as one absence.</dd>
<dt>Expectation of respect</dt><dd>Regardless of sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, religion, age and ability, you will be treated and respected as a human being. Your continued presence in this course signals your commitment to act likewise toward your peers and your instructors.</dd>
<dt>Expectation of integrity</dt><dd>Students are expected to cultivate personal and academic integrity. Review the student code of conduct for university polices on academic misconduct. Academic misconduct will not be tolerated and will result in a failing grade on the assignment and/or in the course. The full handbook is available online at: <a href="http://www2.winthrop.edu/studentaffairs/handbook/StudentHandbook.pdf">http://www2.winthrop.edu/studentaffairs/handbook/StudentHandbook.pdf</a>.</dd>
<dt>Academic misconduct</dt><dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>
As noted in the Student Conduct Code: "Responsibility for good conduct rests with students as adult individuals." The policy on student academic misconduct is outlined in the "Student Conduct Code Academic Misconduct Policy" in the online Student Handbook which can be accessed at<br />
<a href="http://www.winthrop.edu/uploadedFiles/studentconduct/StudentHandbook.pdf">http://www.winthrop.edu/uploadedFiles/studentconduct/StudentHandbook.pdf</a>. <br />
Dishonesty is a serious offense in all its forms, whether lying about reasons for an absence or missed assignment or cheating on a test or misrepresenting borrowed material as your own. It can result in a failing grade on a test, assignment, or the course, or even dismissal from the university. 
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Plagiarism</dt><dd>Plagiarism is the use of someone else’s thoughts, words, ideas, or lines of argument in your own work without appropriate documentation (a parenthetical citation at the end and a listing in "Works Cited")–whether you use that material in a quotation, paraphrase, or summary. It is a theft of intellectual property and will not be tolerated, whether intentional or not. It is also a violation of the Student Conduct Code (<a href="http://www.winthrop.edu/studentaffairs/Judicial/judcode.htm">http://www.winthrop.edu/studentaffairs/Judicial/judcode.htm</a>). Plagiarism will result in failure on that assignment. Especially serious cases or second offences can result in failure in the course.</dd>
<dt>Cell phones</dt><dd>Cell phones normally have no use in this class and when they are being used in class the reflect disrespect for their peers and their instructors &#x2013; a violation of the point above about our <b>expectation of respect</b>. <b>Phones  should be on silent and kept in your book bag or purse throughout class time unless otherwise instructed</b>. Except with permission, texting or responding to email will result in a "0" for participation for the day. If a cell phone is found to be in evidence  during class hours,  the owner of the phone will be marked absent for the day. If it is a quiz day, their quiz will be marked 0 (zero). If a student responds to text messages or email during class they will receive a "0" for the day's participation. There will be no  further warnings given.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>
(<i>Note if you have some educational, health, or physical reason for an electronic device you must work with your instructor to inform him of the accommodation</i>.)
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Computers and other devices</dt><dd>There are clear uses for computers in the classroom, including; taking notes, reading digital textbooks, looking for reference information, etc. Equally clearly, computers provide easy distraction from the responsibilities we all bring to the classroom, including; checking email, browsing on Facebook®, etc., etc. These devices are allowed in my classroom, but any evidence of using them for anything other than clear classroom work will result in an assignment of "0" for the day's participation grade.</dd>
<dt>University Policy re. Handheld Tech Devices</dt><dd></dd>
</dl>

<p>
Except as noted above my policy follows that of the division of Arts and Sciences found at<br />
<a href="http://www.winthrop.edu/uploadedFiles/artscience/PolicyForHandHeldTech-April2014.pdf">http://www.winthrop.edu/uploadedFiles/artscience/PolicyForHandHeldTech-April2014.pdf</a>.<br />
In part that policy reads as follows:
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Policy</b>:
Unless otherwise specified by the instructor on the syllabus, the following statements govern the appropriate use of hand-held and wireless technologies in courses in the College of Arts and Sciences. 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Communication by electronic devices, including but not limited to instant messaging, text messaging, emailing, web surfing, and telephoning during class, is strictly prohibited unless expressly designated as part of the learning activities. Students may not use cell phones, pagers, PDAs, or similar communication devices during scheduled course meetings (including class time, laboratories, review sessions, individual instruction, or similar activities) in the College. Such devices must be silenced or turned off and should not be taken out during course meetings. Electronic audio or video recording of the classroom environment is prohibited unless permission is given by the instructor prior to recording.</li>

<p>
I know that I do make mistakes and overlook things that I shouldn't. It's probably true of some of you as well. If you don't understand a grade or comment, please ask me. If you think that a grade is in error and you would like it corrected, you must put your request and justification in writing. Under no circumstances will a grade be lowered because clarification was requested. No grades will be changed, however, without documentation.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdc297ef">
<p>
Participation and engagement are essential elements in the RELG 101 classroom.  You should seek to demonstrate your intellectual curiosity through demonstrated knowledge of the reading assignments, thoughtful reflection of the topics, contribution of insightful ideas and consideration of your classmates’ perspectives. Consider the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do you arrive at class on time, each class period, with a positive, open attitude?</li>
<li>Did you critically read the material? Are there markings, highlights, and questions written in your book?  Have you completed your reading journals?</li>
<li>Have you thoughtfully considered the readings prior to arriving in class?</li>
<li>Can you answer questions about the current readings and connect these ideas with previous readings in the class?</li>
<li>Do you ask good questions? Do you listen to your peers?</li>
<li>Are your questions and comments deep and related to the reading, or shallow and random?</li>
<li><p>
Are you willing to challenge your thoughts and opinions and those of others in a respectful, open manner?  Are you willing to consider “what if I am wrong?”
</p>

<p>
Disagreement is a basic element of a democratic society.  Diverse perspectives are appreciated and encouraged.  You are expected to show respect to your instructor and your peers.  Students should work to create a classroom community where all perspectives are heard and appreciated.  This classroom is a safe environment in which regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, natural origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, political beliefs, age, or ability, you will be treated with respect.
