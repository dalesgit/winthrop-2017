### New Testament (1st c.) environment

- expectations **Messiah** "anointed one"
- **euvangelion** as a new genre
- Pharisees
- Sadducees
- scribes
- Essenes (Qumran, Dead Sea Scrolls) (desire to purify the Temple and the Land)
- "Zealots" -- legacy of Maccabbees (rebellion and armed resistance to the occupiers)

### 4 **annonymous** portraits

#### Compare the beginnings (288)

#### Yancey: e.g. From silent film, and BBC

##### Questions

- What is Jesus like?
- What is the basic message?
- What is the audience?
- Which is more true?

Note:
40 years or so between productions, very different audience, from perspective of 30 ce the world had shifted: rebellion, occupation crushed, Jerusalem destroyed, Jews banished from Judea

Not a verbatim, life-report (What really happened? How do we know what's true?)

the critical reading skills we have tried to develop.

Clearly for some reading is a matter of religious faith and one doesn't need to read critically. I have found that the two are different, but reading the text critically has had the effect of strengthening my faith -- although it may not always seem that at first.
