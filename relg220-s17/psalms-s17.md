Note:
### Lament or Praise

It’s worth noting that the book of Psalms contains more lament psalms than any other genre, suggesting lament's prevalence in the institutional liturgies of Israel's temple, shrines, and family life. Differently from the more cosmopolitan and dispassionate Wisdom Literature, lament interrogates similar questions around divine justice and God's ways with God's creatures. If (lamentably) rare in today's regular worship, lament still finds voice in observances for the deceased, private and family devotion, and pastoral care.

## From "Who wrote it" to 

### "Life-setting" (*Sitz im Leben*)

- H. Gunkel developed "form analysis" of psalms
- ask what was the function of this song in ancient Israelite society?

## Suggestions for reading Psalms

1. Analyze the structure of a psalm. 
3. Note the form. 
4. Ponder the function. 
5. Feel the emotions. 
6. Avoid theological dissection. 
7. Do not try to tame the psalms. 

Note:
1. Analyze the structure of a psalm. Identify how the material is organized to produce the overall effect of the poem.
2. Look for uses of parallelism. Observe where and how the psalm might use synonymous or antithetic parallelism and ponder what effect these techniques have on understanding the message.
3. Note the form. Look for characteristics that identify the psalm as an example of a particular type or form.
4. Ponder the function. Ask how the psalm would have functioned in ancient Israelite society.
5. Feel the emotions. Try to identify with the emotions expressed in the psalm.
6. Avoid theological dissection. Do not analyze the content of a psalm as if it were an attempt to teach theological principles. Psalms talk more to God than they do about God.
7. Do not try to tame the psalms. Let them express their fierce anger or wildly exuberant praise. Let them assert love for God and hatred of enemies, and do not focus on determining

An old tradition that is alive and well in the Great Smoky Mountains, shape note or "Old Harp" singing blends a unique singing style with tunes from the old world. The technique was created around 1800 to instruct singers how to read music and improve congregational singing, but has held on as a spiritual practice and a time of fellowship for singers in the area.

### "Dizzi Jig" Folk Medieval hammered dulcimer music by dizzi

- https://youtu.be/TxjpYHhfRyI?list=PL03E55B74573A62D8
- The hammered dulcimer probably originated in the Middle East about 900 A.D. and is related to the much older psaltery

Note:
The hammered dulcimer probably originated in the Middle East about 900 A.D. and is related to the much older psaltery. It spread from there across North Africa and was brought into Europe by the Spanish Moors during the 12th century A.D. It is possible that hammered dulcimers were played even earlier than this in Ireland, where they were called "tympanons."

### The Lyre Of Megiddo

The "lyre of Har Megiddo" is an instrument etched onto an ivory plaque that was discovered by archaeologist Gordon Loud in the excavations of a royal palace in the ancient city of Megiddo (aka Armageddon) in Israel. One of the interesting things about this image, which appears at the beginning of this video, is that it dates from roughly the time of the biblical King David (slightly before 1000 B.C.) and if David played a harp, as the Tanach (Old Testament) says he did, it was almost certainly an instrument of this sort.  
  
David's instrument, which was called a "kinnor" in ancient Hebrew, had ten strings, and we know that he played it "with his hand" (as opposed to using a plectrum or pick for strumming - 1 Samuel 13:9). Being curious as to what this instrument might have sounded like, I built a replica of it, and that is what I am playing in this video. It is tuned to an F harmonic minor scale, and strung with pure silk. Harps and lyres in ancient time were strung with gut but silk, when it is properly prepared, is equally hard, strong and resonant.   
  
Was this the sound that lulled troubled King Saul to sleep? We cannot know for sure, but it is possible. If you are curious about this instrument, here is a page on my website that explains a little about its construction and history.
