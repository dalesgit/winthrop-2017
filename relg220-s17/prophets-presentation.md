### What is a prophet


Robert's other brother Edward famously quoted it (*paraphrasing it even
further*), to conclude his eulogy to his late brother after his
assassination (*8 June 1968*): **Some men see things as they are and say
why? I dream things that never were and say why not?**

**Definitions**

Prophet
:   The English word that comes from the Greek prophētēs, which is
    commonly used in the Septuagint to translate the Hebrew word nābî’.
    A prophet is a messenger of God, one who is entrusted with a message
    from God that is addressed to a specific group of people in a
    particular historical context.

Former Prophets
:   Jewish title for the historical works contained in the second
    division of the Hebrew Bible, the Prophets. These books include
    Joshua, Judges, 1–2 Samuel and 1–2 Kings. Jewish scholars attributed
    the authorship of these books to various prophets.

Latter Prophets
:   include the Major Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel) and the
    Minor Prophets (Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum,
    Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi).
    Major Prophets. The longer prophetic works in the Latter Prophets in
    the Hebrew Bible: Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel.

Book of the Twelve
:   Jewish title for the scroll containing the twelve Minor Prophets:
    Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk,
    Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. Ecstatic. A word commonly
    used in some ancient Near Eastern texts to describe prophets.

Minor Prophets
:   The shorter prophetic works in the Latter Prophets in the Hebrew
    Bible: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk,
    Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. These documents are
    gathered into one scroll and called the Book of the Twelve.

Social reformers
:   Role played by most of the prophets in the Hebrew Bible. They
    addressed specific historical situations and called upon people to
    live moral and ethical lives in obedience to God, which involved
    bringing social justice to the oppressed.

Omens
:   Signs that are interpreted to yield divine guidance. In the ancient
    Near East omens were believed to come not only in dreams and visions
    but also through the position of stars, the casting of lots, the
    configuration of flights of birds, how smoke rises from incense,
    signs in the livers of sacrificial animals, the way in which oil
    floats on water, and a number of other methods. Similar methods of
    interpreting omens today include horoscopes and reading tea leaves
    or lines on the palms of a person’s hands.

Oracles
:   The often sermonic sayings, the messages from God (usually in
    poetic structure) delivered by the prophets.

Prophetic frenzy
:   The ecstatic state in which a person receives a divine message to be
    delivered to others. Prophets sometimes used music to induce this
    trance-like state.

Seer
:   An older title for a prophet.

Isaiah
:   Jerusalem prophet who prophesied from 742 to about 701 BCE, warning
    the people of Judah that God was sending the Assyrians as judgment
    for their sins and for their turning away from God. He preached that
    God would preserve a remnant of faithful Judeans who would return to
    the land. Most of Isaiah 1–39 consists of material from the time of
    this influential eighth-century prophet.

Second Isaiah
:   Oracles from a Judean prophet who lived among the exiles in Babylon
    and prophesied words of hope to them in the time period when Cyrus
    the Persian conquered in Babylon in 539 BCE and issued an edict
    allowing the Judeans to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple.

Third Isaiah
:   Oracles from a prophet who apparently lived among the Judeans who
    returned from exile in Babylon to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem.
    These oracles are found in Isaiah 56–66.

Jeremiah
:   Prophet who prophesied in Jerusalem beginning about 627 and died in
    Egypt some time after 587 BCE. He warned Judah that God would
    destroy them by the Babylonians if they did not repent and turn back
    to God. Jeremiah is known as the weeping prophet—a man of
    deep emotions. He predicted that Judean exiles would return to the
    land, but he told those in exile to settle in to their new homes,
    because they would be in Babylon for 70 years.

Ezekiel
:   Prophet who prophesied from 592 to around 571 BCE to the Judeans
    living in exile in Babylon. He pronounced judgment on those who
    remained in Judah, but he reassured the exiles that God had not
    forgotten them—that there would be a glorious future for God’s
    people in the land of Israel.

Amos
:   A prophet from Tekoa in Judah who journeyed north to Israel about
    760 BCE to condemn the way the wealthy abused the poor. He sharply
    criticized social injustice and sarcastically denounced the way
    wealthy Israelites were scrupulous in their religious practices but
    unscrupulous in their treatment of others.

### Our expectations
- prophets as future-tellers
- We've just seen how what we call "history" in the Bible is more **theology** than what we call history
- so **prophecy** in the bible is much more complex than future-telling

### Exercise
*Yesterday, the director of the FBI testified before congress about 2 things: 1) what evidence there was for the President's claim that his predecessor wire-tapped his phone and 2) what the status is of the FBI's investigation of Russian involvement in our election and possible links to the Trump campaign.* 

--

*In groups look at several sources of news and analysis of the above story and discuss:*

- which source or analysis is most reliable? Why?
- which source is most truthful? is it the same thing as reliable? Why?
- which source paints the most reliable picture of the future impact of the event on the country? Why?
- how does the source convey its judgment?

**Note that we are not looking to judge the "correct" political position but rather the criteria for judging sources.**

### Prophecy changed over time p. 264

predictors of the future

Complexity: dramatic visual aids 259­60 vivid word pictures (Ezek)
Nabi': former prophets and latter prophets p. 261 re. Christian grouping
puts former in "historical" category

---

### How to interpret "oracles"


- how tell real from false: **read p. 262**
- Saul and other kings consulted prophets for divine guidance: in the
    pay of kings
- p. 265 many different methods for getting divine guidance: some sounding
    a lot like magic
- biblical prophets (in contrast to others Near Eastern (267) tended
    not to be on payroll

---

### (269) suggestions for interpreting

- consider the historical context
- identify oracles
- think **poetry**
- Look for vivid expressions
- watch for emotional expressions
- ponder the significance of the prophet’s message for contemporary
    life

Note:
(268) editorial process Overview

### Major Prophets pt 2

---
### Isaiah the "fifth gospel"


- is cited many times in the New Testament and the book has been called
“the fifth Gospel” because of it. 
- Isaiah 7:14 speaks of a sign
of the birth of a son who will be called “Immanuel” (God with us). 

Note:
This
text says that the son will be born of a “young woman.” This word came
to be understood as “virgin” in the Greek translation (Septuagint). The
Gospel of Matthew, working from the Greek version, connects Isaiah 7:14
to Jesus’ birth by the Virgin Mary. In its context, however, Isaiah 7:14
refers to the near birth of a son, and before than son is old enough to
know right from wrong (perhaps the age of 12 or 13?), the threat of
invasion King Ahaz fears will come to nothing.

    and what is my resting place?
 All these things my hand has made,

    who trembles at my word.

### Ezekiel (mysticism) 1:4-28

- like "science-fiction" **Ezek. 1:13-14** (later source for Jewish **mysticism**)
- addressed to the exiles
- vision of glorious rebuilding of Jerusalem & the Temple
- "a new heart and a new spirit" **Ezek 36:26-28**

Note:
   Merkabah/Merkavah mysticism (or Chariot mysticism) is a school of
    early Jewish mysticism, c. 100 BCE – 1000 CE, centered on visions
    such as those found in the Book of Ezekiel chapter 1, or in the
    hekhalot ("palaces") literature, concerning stories of ascents to
    the heavenly palaces and the Throne of God. The main corpus of the
    Merkabah literature was composed in Israel in the period 200–700 CE,
    although later references to the Chariot tradition can also be found
    in the literature of the Chassidei Ashkenaz in the Middle Ages. A
    major text in this tradition is the Maaseh Merkabah (Works of the
    Chariot).[^3]
