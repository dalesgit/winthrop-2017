Note:
Saint Valentine, officially known as Saint Valentine of Rome, is a third-century Roman saint widely celebrated on February 14 and commonly associated with "courtly love."  
  
Although not much of St. Valentine's life is reliably known, and whether or not the stories involve two different saints by the same name is also not officially decided, it is highly agreed that St. Valentine was martyred and then buried on the Via Flaminia to the north of Rome.  
  
In 1969, the Roman Catholic Church removed St. Valentine from the General Roman Calendar, because so little is known about him. However, the church still recognizes him as a saint, listing him in the February 14 spot of Roman Martyrolgy.  
  
The legends attributed to the mysterious saint are as inconsistent as the actual identification of the man. http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=159

<li class="fragment">1. If there had never been a historical people called “Israel” in antiquity, would you say that the exodus 
narrative was true? </li>
<li class="fragment">2. If there had been a people called Israel, but they had not been freed from slavery in Egypt, would you say that the narrative was true? </li>
<li class="fragment">3. If it should turn out that Israel had existed, and had been freed from slavery in Egypt, but they did not receive the Ten Commandments, would you say that the narrative was true? </li>
<li class="fragment">4. If Israel had in fact been freed and had received the Ten Commandments, but it turned out that the tablets were written on tablets of clay, not stone, would you say that the narrative was true? </li>

### Cont.


<li class="fragment">5. If Israel had been freed from slavery, had received the Ten Commandments on tablets of stone, but it turned out that Moses made them up, rather than receiving them from God, would the story be true? </li>
<li class="fragment">6. If it should turn out that Israel was freed from slavery, did receive the Ten Commandments, written on tablets of stone, and that the commandments had come from God but had not actually been “written by the finger of God,” would you say that the narrative was true? </li>
<li class="fragment">7. And finally, what if it should turn out that God does not have fingers?
 </li>
