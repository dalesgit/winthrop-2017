Imagine that you have come across a news article. It goes like this:

Members of the 442nd gathered this week to remember one of their most important battles.

The famed Battle of the Bulge was fought 60 years ago this week. It was a make or break event for the allies. The Germans knew that this was their last hope of averting a terrible end to the war and so they had launched everything they had against the allies. 

Things seemed to be going well for the Germans. A fierce winter fog had hemmed the allies in a forest. The fighting was ferocious, but it seemed as if the Germans were advancing on their goal of cutting off the allied front.

--

Then on Christmas day the great break occurred. A puka opened up in the clouds and the allied bombers were able to begin attacking the Germans. The tide had turned. And eventually the German attack was repulsed and the allies were poised to cross into Germany itself.

It was a grand day for all the veterans gathered.

## a poem by Wilfred Owens

"Parable of the Old Man and the Young"
 
 So Abram rose, and clave the wood, and went,  
 And took the fire with him, and a knife.  
 And as they sojourned both of them together,  
 Isaac the first-born spake and said, My Father,  
 Behold the preparations, fire and iron,  
 But where the lamb for this burnt-offering?  
 Then Abram bound the youth with belts and straps,  
 and builded parapets and trenches there,  
 And stretch√®d forth the knife to slay his son.  

--

 When lo! an angel called him out of heaven,  
 Saying, Lay not thy hand upon the lad,  
 Neither do anything to him. Behold,  
 A ram, caught in a thicket by its horns;  
 Offer the Ram of Pride instead of him.  
 But the old man would not so, but slew his son,  
 And half the seed of Europe, one by one.
