### An example of reading a text

- A major theme of this class is asking the right questions of the texts that we read -- in particular the Bible. This is especially challenging when the text is familiar to us, as the Bible often is.
- Read the handout. As you are reading, write down questions that come to mind as you are reading. This might be things you would like clarification about. It might be things that puzzle you.
- Share with a group around you.
