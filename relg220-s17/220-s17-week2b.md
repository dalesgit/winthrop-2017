## Translation approaches

- Literal equivalence
- Dynamic equivalence
- Paraphrase

---
## Watershed dates

- 586 bce
- 70 ce

--

## Words of a prophet

- Isaiah preached 
- School gathered over 200 years 
- after exile written on scrolls 
- as people lost Hebrew in diaspora translated into Greek
- paraphrase and commentary continued in Hebrew and  Aramaic

--

## LXX

- earliest Christians are Greek speaking so used Greek Bible
- as they wrote their own scripture they usually quoted from LXX
- the two most quoted texts by Christians in their "scripture" are Psalms & Isaiah
- in time the Church divided into Latin & Greek speaking parts, lasting until the Reformation
- The codex began to replace the scroll almost as soon as it was invented. In Egypt, by the fifth century.

## Rabbis and Hebrew Bible 

- didn't include material from the Greek period 
- Essenes had a Hebrew text very close to present day text - - not seen until Dead Sea Scrolls. As Jews were annihilated and banished by Romans, 60-135 ce, their library was hidden away in jars stored in cliffs above the Dead Sea (Qumran)
- by ca. 800 ce in response to increasing loss of ability to read Hebrew began to put vowels into the text (Masoretes)

--


## Reformation sought a return to "apostolic" roots

- in this case assuming that the text of "Old Testament" developed by the Rabbi's was more "original" the text of the Latin & Greek church was rejected in favor of the Hebrew Bible
- this gave rise to distinctions such as "Apocrypha", "Deutero-canonical" and Protestant Bible. The Latin translation of the 3rd c. ce continued to be normative Catholic church until 20th c.

--

## 20th c.

- 18th-20th c. developments in critical reading of historical literature as well as ancient scripture 
- discover of "Isaiah Scroll" at Qumran confirmed a relatively continuous text since 1st c.
- the Dead Sea documents are the oldest egs of biblical texts remaining -- 200-300 years  earlier than the next oldest.
- one can see the Isaiah scroll in Jerusalem and on Internet <http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/isaiah>
