## Torah


*Ethics of the Fathers*: Chapter One

Moses received the Torah from Sinai and gave it over to Joshua. Joshua
gave it over to the Elders, the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets
gave it over to the Men of the Great Assembly. They [+] would always
say these three things: Be cautious in judgement. Establish many pupils.
And make a safety fence around the Torah.

[+] *the **Men of the Great Assembly**, leaders and curators of
the Torah up to the Greek period*]

## Law: historical context


-   Hammurabi & Bible comparison (213)
-   "Laws as Cultural Artifacts (218)

--

## Law: What do we do with this?

--

-   (211) Focus of Judaism
-   Exodus 20–23 (227)
-   Leviticus cf. Holiness code 17-26 having to do with priestly
    interests, ceremonial, etc.
-   Christian view to the "authority" of these texts is contested –
    *focus on "moral" precepts?*

--

-   cf. Dr Laura quote (re. how to take these texts)
    -   <http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_drl.htm> a balanced site
        see their statement of beliefs
    -   a web site with further explanations from a conservative
        Christian perspective. <http://www.repentuk.com/laura.html>
    -   cf. Suggestions: (220)

--

## Law: *apodictic* & *casuistic*


-   "10 Words" (*Exodus 20:1–17*, and then at *Deuteronomy 5:6–21*)
-   cp. 2 variations in nature of **covenant**:
    -   absolute
    -   form of if ... then ...

--

## 2nd Law (Deutero + nomos)



-   crafted as a re-telling to the people by Moses at the end of his
    life
-   obedience to the laws is primary means for experiencing God's
    blessings and disobedience as the way to experience God's curses
    (*Deut. 11:26-28*) (228)
-   *1 Kings 22* King Josiah "discovers" a copy of the Torah
-   under the care of the **men of the Great Assembly**
-   by 1st c. ce Torah was understood to be **God's eternal will**

--

## History & Theology


-   history is always in a **context** (236)
-   cp. "theological reasons for victory and defeat" (box 239)
-   "history books in the Bible" (box 240)
-   concept of "Deuteronomistic History" (242)
-   evidence of multiple sources in the text
    -   Joshua-Judges: Different traditions on the Conquest (243 ff.)
        cf. box (245)
-   Message: beware idolatry & punishment from God because of
    unfaithfulness to God

--

## Covenants


### If ... then ... vs. everlasting covenant

-   Abraham
-   Moses
-   David

### Chronicles seeks to "sanitize" David's lineage

--

## History & Prophets


(254) "The main message communicated in the historical books of the
Hebrew Bible (e.g. not Maccabees) matches on that the prophets of Israel
and Judah presented with considerable power." … "The similarities are so
strong that the Deuteronomistic Historian and the Chronicler must have
been profoundly influenced by the prophets."
