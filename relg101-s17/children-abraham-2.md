### schools of Hillel & Shammai 
**during formative period**

  
- [about Hillel](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/hillel.html)
- [read from /Pirke Aboth/](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/pirkei_avot.html)


Note:
In the first century BCE, Babylonian born Hillel (later known as Hillel the Elder) migrated to the Land of Israel to study and worked as a woodcutter, eventually becoming the most influential force in Jewish life. Hillel is said to have lived in such great poverty that he was sometimes unable to pay the admission fee to study Torah, and because of him that fee was abolished. He was known for his kindness, gentleness, concern for humanity. 

--

### Shammai

Hillel the Elder's friendly adversary was Shammai, a native of the Land of Israel about whom little is known except that he was a builder, known for the strictness of his views. He was reputed to be quick-tempered and impatient. Both lived during the reign of King Herod (37-4 BCE), an oppressive period in Jewish history because of the Roman occupation of the Land of Israel. Shammai was concerned that if Jews had too much contact with the Romans, the Jewish community would be weakened, and this attitude was reflected in his strict interpretation of Jewish law. Hillel did not share Shammai's fear and therefore was more liberal in his view of law.


--

### Hillel

**On the "Golden Rule"**
Once there was a gentile who came before Shammai, and said to him: "Convert me on the condition that you teach me the whole Torah while I stand on one foot. Shammai pushed him aside with the measuring stick he was holding. The same fellow came before Hillel, and Hillel converted him, saying: That which is despicable to you, do not do to your fellow, this is the whole Torah, and the rest is commentary, go and learn it."  - Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 31a

**If Not Now, When?**
"If I am not for myself, then who will be for me? And if I am only for myself, then what am I? And if not now, when?"

--

**On Time for Study**
"Do not say: 'When I have leisure I shall study,' perhaps you will never have leisure."

- "The Meccan suras of the Quran have a dramatic eschatological emphasis" (apocalyptic)
- Clearly the "redaction" of the Quran as we have it today took some time after Muhammad's death, it is still relatively little understood
- Islam became quickly an **urban** religion, "and so a scribal and literary one."
