## Introduction

- During its 2,500-year history, from the time of the Buddha to the present day, Buddhism has grown from a tiny religious community in northern India into a movement that now spans the globe.

- the tradition begins simply with a **human being â€“ Siddhartha Gautama** who found a solution to the problem of human suffering. 
- Buddhists focus on his experience, and they **deny the existence of a single, almighty God.** 

--

- The most basic Buddhist expression of faith is called the triple refuge: 
	- I take refuge in the **Buddha**; 
	- I take refuge in the **Dharma** [*the Buddhas teaching*]; 
	- I take refuge in the **Samgha** [*the community of the Buddhas followers*].

Note:
The Buddhist tradition will challenge us to look in new ways at some basic religious questions: What is ultimate reality? How can I know it? And does it love me? Many religious traditions emphasize the importance of an immortal soul. This is not so in Buddhism.

## Buddha

- The doctrine of reincarnation or rebirth is known as **samsara** (literally, *wandering*). Samsara was not considered a pleasant prospect. For many people, it was not an opportunity as much as it was a burden, and they tried to find a way out.
- The release from **samsara**  is found in **moksha**
- Four Noble Truths are: 
  
  1.  the truth of suffering (**Gurkha**): *all is suffering*
  2.  the truth of the arising of suffering: *it is from desire*
  3.  the truth of the cessation of suffering (also known as **nirvana** or **nibbana**): *i.e. cease from desire*
  4.  the truth of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering: *via 8-fold path*

Note:
Buddhists have a rich tradition of stories and legends about the Buddha. The stories begin with the Buddhas previous lives. Buddhist tradition arose at a time when the doctrine of reincarnation was a basic assumption in Indian religious life.

##  Chinese adoption of Buddhism blended with an adaptation of Chinese Taoism
  
 The Tao that can be told of is not the eternal Tao; 
 The name that can be named is not the eternal name. 
 The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth; 
 The Named is the mother of all things.  
 The Tao is empty like a bowl.  
 It may be used but its capacity is never exhausted.
