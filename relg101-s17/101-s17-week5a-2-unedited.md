## Complexity of subject

- Those who have conceptualized **Hinduism** have been western European

## Questions

<li class="fragment">1.  When you attempt to understand a new religious tradition, what is the most important thing to learn? Would you focus on its doctrines, the way it tells stories, its art, its rituals, or its institutions? Would you focus on something else? </li>


<li class="fragment">2.  If you were trying to explain your own religious tradition to someone who knew nothing about it, what would be the most important thing for that person to learn? </li>

## Hinduism 

- Hinduism is not **just** a part or aspect of Indian life or culture; it is far more encompassing than that. 
- It structures and influences every aspect of Hindu life, including 
	- arts, 
	- music, 
	- medicine, 
	- etc.

Note:
and the like, which may explain the lack of a specific self-referential term.

## ca. 1500 BCE  "Aryan infusion"

- pastoral nomads from Central Asia
- their language became  "Sanskrit": they left behind their scripture: *Veda*

Note:
cf. Douglas, chs 1-2 *Purity and Danger* <http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/schloesser/HS041-042/fall/w04/resources/DOUGLAS_Purity-Danger.pdf>

## Veda

- most authoritative text for Hinduism

- composed between 2300 and 1200 B.C.E.

- e.g. The oldest and most important of these collections contains more than a thousand songs to various gods and goddesses and is aptly named the Rig, meaning praise. Scholars believe it was composed between 2300 and 1200 B.C.E.

- many different gods sung to

---

##  Humans
- The Veda regarded humans as being individual souls 
	- and members of a stratified society. 
	- For the Aryans, the essence of human life is the soul, which they associated with the **breath**, designated by the word **atman**. 
  
- The Aryans' strong emphasis on **ritual** over **doctrine and belief** - was the basis of the Vedic tradition.

Note:
The Veda regarded humans as being individual souls and members of a stratified society. For the Aryans, the essence of human life is the soul, which they associated with the breath, designated by the word tman. The Sanskrit atman has cognates in the English word atmosphere and the German word atmen, which means to breathe.

## Classical Hinduism

- Transformations of thought in the Axial Age (c. 800--200 B.C.E.) led to the re-evaluation of Vedic ritual and new ideas about the nature of human existence.

- Deeper spiritual questions led to the examination of human nature and the possibility of an **afterlife**. 
- (*This evolution in Indian religion was roughly contemporaneous with similar developments in other civilizations, including ancient Greece, China, Mesopotamia, and Israel.*)

--


- The function of religion changed from that of **cosmic maintenance** to one of **personal enlightenment** and transformation.

- Classical Hinduism established the central problem of human existence for Hindus &#x2013; **samsara**, the cycle of continual **transmigrations of the soul**.


--

- **Karma**, even good **karma**, keeps a person bound to the cycle of transmigration. One path the Hindu tradition offers for the attainment of **moksha**, or ultimate release, is the path of wisdom.

- The path of wisdom found in the Axial Age, when the most important Hindu responses to the anxieties about death and rebirth were recorded in a collection of texts called the **Upanishads**. The oldest of the **Upanishads** was probably composed between 800--400 B.C.E., but actually written down much later.

- Modern Hinduism has had to face challenges brought by the advent of Islam and Western culture. 
 
Note:
Both incursions into India have left profound and lasting imprints on Hinduism.

## Intro from lectures Buddhism

## Introduction

- During its 2,500-year history, from the time of the Buddha to the present day, Buddhism has grown from a tiny religious community in northern India into a movement that now spans the globe.

- the tradition begins simply with a **human beingSiddhartha Gautama**who found a solution to the problem of human suffering. 
- Buddhists focus on his experience, and they **deny the existence of a single, almighty God.** 

--

- The most basic Buddhist expression of faith is called the triple refuge: 
	- I take refuge in the **Buddha**; 
	- I take refuge in the **Dharma** [*the Buddhas teaching*]; 
	- I take refuge in the **Samgha** [*the community of the Buddhas followers*].

Note:
The Buddhist tradition will challenge us to look in new ways at some basic religious questions: What is ultimate reality? How can I know it? And does it love me? Many religious traditions emphasize the importance of an immortal soul. This is not so in Buddhism.

## Buddha

- The doctrine of reincarnation or rebirth is known as samsara (literally, wandering). Samsara was not considered a pleasant prospect. For many people, it was not an opportunity as much as it was a burden, and they tried to find a way out.

- Four Noble Truths are: 
  
  1.  the truth of suffering (**dukkha**), &#x2013; all is suffering
  
  2.  the truth of the arising of suffering, &#x2013; it is from desire
  
  3.  the truth of the cessation of suffering (also known as **nirvana** or **nibbana**), &#x2013; i.e. cease from desire
  
  4.  the truth of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering. &#x2013; via 8-fold path
Note:
Buddhists have a rich tradition of stories and legends about the Buddha. The stories begin with the Buddhas previous lives. Buddhist tradition arose at a time when the doctrine of reincarnation was a basic assumption in Indian religious life. 

--

## The path to nirvana is divided into eight categories:

- right understanding,

- right thought,

- right speech,

- right action,

- right livelihood,

- right effort,

- right mindfulness,

- right concentration.

--

**The logic might be expressed in 3 categories:**

- **sila**, or moral conduct; 
- **samadhi**, or mental concentration; and 
- **pa-a**, or wisdom

Note:
Buddhists have a rich tradition of stories and legends about the Buddha. The stories begin with the Buddhas previous lives. Buddhist tradition arose at a time when the doctrine of reincarnation was a basic assumption in Indian religious life. , or wisdom.

- The contents of the Buddhist scriptures often are quite simple and pragmatic.

---

## Mahayana arose as reform ca. 0 CE

- spread to China, Tibet, Japan, Korea, Vietnam

- One of the Mahayana traditions most important innovations is the **bodhisattva** ideal. A **bodhisattva** is a Buddha-to-be or future Buddha who does not attempt to go straight to **nirvana** but returns to this world to help others along the path.

- **emptiness**: Hinduism there is an eternal self. Buddhism there is  "no-self"

- **non-duality** (physical / spiritual)

--

## Complex histories of relationship between politics and Buddhism throughout Asia

- Burma / Myanmar

- Tibet

- Chinese adoption of Buddhism blended with an adaptation of Chinese Taoism
  
 The Tao that can be told of is not the eternal Tao;  
 The name that can be named is not the eternal name.  
 The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;  
 The Named is the mother of all things.  
 The Tao is empty like a bowl.  
 It may be used but its capacity is never exhausted.
