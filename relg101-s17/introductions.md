# A Definition of Religion (1)
- The terms “religion” and “religious” are used every day to describe:
  - places
  - actions
  - ways of thinking and feeling
  - persons or groups who engage in certain rituals

- The search for definitions is a search for boundaries; a desire to say that X is religious and Y is not.
