### Worship & Judaism

- Torah worship: especially re. sacrifice
- lunar calendar: 3 great pilgrimage festivals: Booths, Passover, Weeks. Solemn festivals: Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur.
- post-exile: development of Synagogue (no more Temple, no more sacrifice)
- public worship followed a pattern: reading from scripture, Aramaic translation (targum), chanting a psalm, homily by preacher

--
### Comparisons

- Eucharist is interpreted through lens of "sacrifice" -- "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us"
- Islam emerged from a religious culture that also focused on sacrifice
- scripture reading and homily is a shared pattern across all 3 religions
- lunar calendar followed in part by all 3 religions

### Christianity

- Jesus & 1st Christians accepted 2nd Temple sacrifices

- at first celebrated homes, then basilica as became establishment
- develop Bishops and parallel development **presbyters** (elders)

--
### Comparisons

### Worship at Mecca

- evidence of sacrifice prior to Muhammad
- Kaaba was house of "the god" -- "al-ilah" => "Allah"
- pressure of radical **monotheism** had constant impact on "prayer" (salat)
- unlike Jews and Christians Muslims would have no seasonal feasts
- but: prayer 5 times per day, fast lunar month Ramadan, hajj
- "umma" = the whole community of Islam
- earliest gathering place Muhammad's house became in time "mosque" (masjid)
- open court for washing, the direction toward Mecca, **qibla**, marked by niche, the **mihrab**, nearby the pulpit **minbar**, outside the minaret, for the calling to prayer by the **muezzin**
- two important seasonal festivals (**id**), sacrificial feast, and breaking of the fast

-- 
### Comparisons

- Each of 3 religions have an emphasis on daily prayer: (Talmudic pattern of 3 times daily, Christian monastic prayer 7 times, Muslim pattern of 5)
- Each has an established association between washing / water and worship
- **fasting** & **feasting** common patterns


---

### Cult of saints

- particularly among Christians, institutionalized. Churches built on the burial site of local saints.
- Judaism & Islam reluctant to extend "veneration" to the saints and heroes, martyrs and confessors

---

#### Closing

- Judaism: symbolic and historical
- Christianity: cosmic and literal
- Islam: calendar fixed on the present, exaltation of God and humble submission
