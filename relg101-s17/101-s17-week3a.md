## Substance or Function?

### Functionalist Definition of Religion
  - Focuses on the role religion plays in the lives of persons and groups.
  - Might focus on the ways religion enables people to sustain hope in the face of difficult circumstances.

### Substantive Definition of Religion
  - Attempts to limit the phenomena that may be characterized as religious.
  - Seeks to identify what it is that makes certain responses to death and suffering religious and others not.


--

## Substance and Function (16 ff)

- Considerations of function are necessary but not sufficient to the task of defining religion.
- But an adequate definition of religion must include a substantive component.
- Thus, any adequate definition of religion must account for both the function and substance of religion.


---

## A Proposed Definition of Religion (20 ff)

### Religion signifies those ways of viewing the world that refer to:
  - 1 a notion of sacred reality
  - 2 made manifest in human experience
  - 3 in such a way as to produce long-lasting ways of thinking, feeling, and acting
  - 4 with respect to problems of ordering and understanding existence

## The Sacred

### A Notion of Sacred Reality

- A notion of sacred reality establishes a boundary between religion and non-religion.
- “Sacred” indicates a reality that is somehow distinct, “set apart,” “other” than ordinary.
- “Sacred reality” includes the God of the Bible, the Qur’anic Allah, the Brahman of Hinduism, Buddhism’s Nirvana, the kami of Shinto.


--

## Manifest in Human Experience

- Although the sacred is “set apart” from the ordinary, it nevertheless may be experienced, thought about, and acted upon.
- Thus, all religion has to do with “the element of the sacred” manifesting itself in various ways: in rituals, persons, and natural phenomena. 
  - Muslims = the sacred reality (Allah) is made manifest through prophecy
  - Buddhists = the goal of Nirvana “comes to life” in the life and teaching of the Buddha
  - Navaho = the story of the Navaho people makes wisdom available for those who seek harmony between all things.


--

## Long-Lasting Ways of Thinking and Feeling

- Religious ways develop over time.  And they come to constitute traditions that may be identified with the history of particular communities.
- For example, the prophecy of Muhammad is the beginning of the tradition of Islam.
- Islam’s message and the story of its revelation in seventh-century Arabia have produced characteristic modes of thought, feeling, and action among a large percentage of the world’s population.


--

## Ordering and Understanding Existence

- Stresses the way in which notions of sacred reality are related to problems of suffering and death.
- Also stresses the way in which notions of sacred reality are related to other problems—such as the ordering of political or economic life.

## 3 patterns of understanding the appearance of the sacred 
- **Prophetic** (stress on belief, society, and morality—all centered on revelation) Moses.  Mohammed.  A prophet is a person who receives a revelation that deals with historical life of community. 
- **Sacramental** (stress on sacred objects and ritual as vehicles for the sacred), Jesus. The presence of sacred through an aspect of material reality or objects; stresses role of priests.
- **Mystical** (stress on states of consciousness, feeling, and experience) the Buddha.  Emphasis on a state of being or consciousness, such as enlightenment or contact with God.

- **person—prophet** (prophetic), **God incarnate** (sacramental), and **sage** (mystical), 
- **objects—texts** (prophetic), bread, wine & material objects (sacramental), breathing & tea (mystical) 
- **time—linear/historical** (prophetic) v. **cyclical** (often mystical) [sacramental can be either]
- **space—places of revelations**, places of worship, stupa, and nature (note how all 3 patterns apply)
