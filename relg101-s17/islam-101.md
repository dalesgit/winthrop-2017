## Children of Abraham

### Scriptures: preliminary ###

- Abraham source in all 3
- Genesis 12
- Question: the same God?
    - Elohim, YHWH
    - Father, Son, Holy Spirit
    - Allah

Note:
References to Abraham in the Quran[edit] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_in_Islam#References_to_Abraham_in_the_Quran>
There are numerous references to Abraham in the Quran, including, twice, to the Scrolls of Abraham;[62] in the latter passage, it is mentioned that Abraham "fulfilled his engagements?-",[63] a reference to all the trials that Abraham had succeeded in. In a whole series of chapters, the Quran relates how Abraham preached to his community as a youth and how he specifically told his father, named Azar,[64] to leave idol-worship and come to the worship of God.[65] Some passages of the Quran, meanwhile, deal with the story of how God sent angels to Abraham with the announcement of the punishment to be imposed upon Lot's people in Sodom and Gomorrah.[66] Other verses mention the near-sacrifice of Abraham's son,[28] whose name is not given but is presumed to be Ishmael as the following verses mention the birth of Isaac.[67] The Quran also repeatedly establishes Abraham's role as patriarch and mentions numerous important descendants who came through his lineage, including Isaac,[68] Jacob[69] and Ishmael.[70] In the later chapters of the Quran, Abraham's role becomes yet more prominent. The Quran mentions that Abraham and Ishmael were the reformers who set up the Kabba in Mecca as a center of pilgrimage for monotheism[71] The Quran consistently refers to Islam as "the Religion of Abraham" (millat Ibrahim)[72] and Abraham is given a title as Hanif (The Pure, "true in Faith" or "upright man").[73] The Quran also mentions Abraham as one whom God took as a friend (Khalil),[38] hence Abraham's title in Islam, Khalil-Allah (Friend of God). The term is considered by some to be a derivation of the patriarch's Hebrew title, Kal El (קל-אל), which means "voice of God".[74][75] Other instances in the Quran which are described in a concise manner are the rescue of Abraham from the fire into which he was thrown by his people';[76][77] his pleading for his father;[78] his quarrel with an unrighteous and powerful king[79] and the miracle of the dead birds.[31]

#### Qur'an 5:46-48 ####

And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary, confirming the Law that had come before him: We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light, and confirmation of the Law that had come before him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah.

Let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) those who rebel.

-- 
*Continued*

To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but (His plan is) to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute;

## Islam & Muslim ##

ISLAM =Religion
MUSLIM=Follower of Islam

---

## A few Misconceptions ##

- Islam and Culture
- Muslims and Arabs
- Status of Women
- Concept of Jihad
- Belief in Jesus


--

## Islam & Culture ##

- What's the difference?
- Multiple cultures; Same beliefs

![](http://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B8ezT0-tUjVZbXlYLVZOdzdKcU0)

---

## Muslims and Arabs ##

- Muslim Population 1.6 - 1.8 Billion
- Largest population of Muslims is in Indonesia, India and China
- Arabs only constitute 15-20% of Muslims
- 90-95% of Arabs are Muslims

--

## Status of Women ##

"Prior to Islam, a woman was regarded by her parents as a threat to family honor and hence worthy of burial alive at infancy. As an adult, she was a sex object that could be bought, sold and inherited. From this position of inferiority and legal incapacity, Islam raised women to a position of influence and prestige in family and society." *Cultural Atlas of Islam*

- Equal vs. Identical
- Examples of Rights 1400 years ago
- Concept of Hijab (Covering)
- Marriage of the Prophet Mohammad (pbuh)

Written on the slide: The Kaabah was built by Abraham and Ishmael as the first place for people to worship the one God.
Video of Hajj: during prayer

## Concept of Jihad ##

- Different Forms of Jihad
- Establishment of Justice
- Rules of Engagement
- "Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors" *Qur'an 2:190*


"History makes it clear however, that the legend of fanatical Muslims sweeping through the world and forcing Islam at the point of the sword upon conquered races is one of the most fanatically absurd myths that historians have ever repeated"
*De Lacy O'Leary – Islam at the Crossroads*

Note:
Include Audio of the Qur'an – Surat Al Fatiha

- This is a 700 year old copy of the Qur'an belonging to Sultan Baybar

-- 

## Jesus (pbuh) ##

- Status in Islam
- Miracles
- Did he die?

 "The similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam He created him from dust then said to him be and he was" *Qur'an 3: 59*

Note:
Some actions of cultures don't represent the teachings of Islam
Pictures of different hijabs (african, arab, etc…)

--

## Shariah ##

- Society
- Economics
- Character of Muslims

In Islam, faith is not an abstract theological dogma, nor an intellectual creed, nor a philosophical proposition... It is the Shari`ah which translates faith and moral ideals into clear, definable, viable, and concrete goals, forms, and codes, and brings them within the grasp of every ordinary man and woman; this is why it is one of the greatest blessings of God and one of the greatest vehicles for human progress.
*Khurram Murad*

Note:
Bolded & underlined text
Maybe take out the writing under each section (just keep quran and sunnah – that's it) the rest should be speaking points.

 Maybe title it "Where does it come from?"
