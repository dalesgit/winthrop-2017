## Hinduism 

- Hinduism is not **just** a part or aspect of Indian life or culture; it is far more encompassing than that. 
- It structures and influences every aspect of Hindu life, including 
	- arts, 
	- music, 
	- medicine, 
	- etc.

Note:
and the like, which may explain the lack of a specific self-referential term.

## Veda

- most authoritative text for Hinduism
- composed between 2300 and 1200 B.C.E.

##  Humans
- The Veda regarded humans as being individual souls 
	- and members of a stratified society. 
	- For the Aryans, the essence of human life is the soul, which they associated with the **breath**, designated by the word **atman**. 
  
- The Aryans' strong emphasis on **ritual** over **doctrine and belief** - was the basis of the Vedic tradition.

Note:
The Veda regarded humans as being individual souls and members of a stratified society. For the Aryans, the essence of human life is the soul, which they associated with the breath, designated by the word tman. The Sanskrit atman has cognates in the English word atmosphere and the German word atmen, which means to breathe.

## Classical Hinduism

- Transformations of thought in the Axial Age (c. 800--200 B.C.E.) led to the re-evaluation of Vedic ritual and new ideas about the nature of human existence.

- Deeper spiritual questions led to the examination of human nature and the possibility of an **afterlife**. 
- (*This evolution in Indian religion was roughly contemporaneous with similar developments in other civilizations, including ancient Greece, China, Mesopotamia, and Israel.*)

--


- The function of religion changed from that of **cosmic maintenance** to one of **personal enlightenment** and transformation.

- Classical Hinduism established the central problem of human existence for Hindus &#x2013; **samsara**, the cycle of continual **transmigrations of the soul**.


--

- **Karma**, even good **karma**, keeps a person bound to the cycle of transmigration. One path the Hindu tradition offers for the attainment of **moksha**, or ultimate release, is the path of wisdom.

- The path of wisdom found in the Axial Age, when the most important Hindu responses to the anxieties about death and rebirth were recorded in a collection of texts called the **Upanishads**. The oldest of the **Upanishads** was probably composed between 800--400 B.C.E., but actually written down much later.

- Modern Hinduism has had to face challenges brought by the advent of Islam and Western culture. 
 
Note:
Both incursions into India have left profound and lasting imprints on Hinduism.
