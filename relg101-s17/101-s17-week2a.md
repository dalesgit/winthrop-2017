## Some examples from your journals

I was more confused than I was surprised about the fact that coming up with a definition of religion is very hard. As I read I tried to come up with my own definition but could not seem to find a handful of words that would sum up every religion in the world as a whole. I never realized how different the many religions are. I also never took into consideration that throughout these many different religions are even smaller subject areas that are broken down even farther. As I thought about my own religion I began to realize that it would be hard to even some up my religion into one definition unless my definition was very long.

### Making connections

There are multiple connections I made with these chapters and its essential components. The authors provide quite a lengthy and rather tedious criteria/outline for what religion truly is. As I studied these criteria, it reminded me greatly of my high school Advanced Statistics class. In the class, we studied a topic known as correlational testing. When practicing problems with this topic, in order to solve a problem, one must meet a prolonged list of criteria for the given problem to be even considered a correlational problem and not a question focused on a differing subject of statistics. If one of the criteria were not met (meaning one of about almost 10 different criteria), the likelihood of the problem being considered correlational begins to decline, and that is the point at which it becomes confusing and rather controversial. 

--

Similarly, the authors mention multiple existing systems of thought that don't necessarily meet their provided criteria, yet they can be debated as being considered religious thought. For example, the authors mention that some forms of Buddhism negate the idea of a god or gods, that they are a distraction. Consequently, the criteria of having a "notion of a sacred reality" is not fully met, meaning some forms of Buddhism become more difficult to classify as a religion to some. 


--

The authors additionally mention Karl Marx and how he denied the idea of religion and saw it as a "false response" to human conflict; however, many embraced his ideology and employed his ideas to overcome barriers in their lives, making his philosophy almost appear as a religion. Such controversies displayed to me that, just like in my statistics class, if some criteria are not met for a mentioned system, the more difficult and controversial it becomes to classify the system as religious. …

### Motivations and Religion

Prior to reading these chapters, I was not fully aware of what exactly defines the word and topic of religion. As I began to study the contents of the chapter, I was a bit confused at first, but I eventually had an epiphany that has aided me in further understanding what religion exactly is. My realization was that the actions we carry out in our day to day lives can either be considered religious or non-religious depending on our purpose behind them. 

--

For example, if we perform prayers, give to the needy, or even dance, are we doing so in a religious manner, meaning are we praying out of fear and love for a particular deity, are we giving to the needy to feel morally correct as well as being accepted by a power above us, and are we perhaps dancing for the purpose of satisfying criteria to properly practice a faith? All of these examples depend on the purpose and reasoning behind doing so. If we pray without a concern towards a higher purpose, if we give to the needy to only make ourselves satisfied without looking to fulfill a religious standard, or even if we dance with no apparent reasoning, the likelihood of the actions being considered religious diminish. Therefore, the chapter ultimately aided me in my understanding of what makes places, things, or even actions "religious" and how some of those things may not be considered religious depending on the context and reasoning behind doing so.

### So many varieties – how understand?

The authors touch on how many others around the world from various cultures may have a very different view of what religion exactly is. I certainly agree with this statement, but it also brings a question to mind. If each person describes religion differently in the world depending on what they practice and what culture they thrive in, does that not make religion even harder to understand and additionally, doesn't this mean that coming to understand religion as whole becomes even more difficult since there is so many existing possible ways to describe it. 

---

### Religion and morality

Although there is a separation between morality and religion, are they really all that different? Morality is typically thought of in the sense of what is good and bad, which seems to be often determined within various religions. There is substance and function within religion and to achieve a wholehearted commitment to a religion, one must live within what is deemed right and wrong. Furthermore, does religion decide the morals or do morals dictate the values within a religion?

---

### Making connections

At the beginning of Chapter 2, "The Nature of the Sacred", the author mentions certain sites like ground zero being refereed to as sacred. In a history class we were discussing concentration camps and some students stated that these sties were sacred. This was due to the fact that what happened there was "other than ordinary" and could be categorized as not tradition specific. Other students disagreed with the use of the word sacred because they saw it as a positive and only recognized it in a religious realm. I connected this to a question discussed during the first week of class about what makes certain things religious, or sacred, and what does not?

## Possible Definitions of Religion

(*James Martineau*)

Religion is the belief in an ever living God, that is, in a **Divine Mind and Will** ruling the Universe and holding moral relations with mankind .

Note:
21 April 1805 – 11 January 1900) was an English religious philosopher influential in the history of Unitarianism.

For 45 years he was Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy and Political Economy in Manchester New College, the principal training college for British Unitarianism.


--

(*Friedrich Schleiermacher*)

Religion is the **feeling of absolute dependence** or the consciousness that the whole of our spontaneous activity comes from a source outside of us .

Note: 
November 21, 1768 – February 12, 1834) was a German theologian, philosopher, and biblical scholar known for his attempt to reconcile the criticisms of the Enlightenment with traditional Protestant Christianity. He also became influential in the evolution of Higher Criticism, and his work forms part of the foundation of the modern field of hermeneutics. Because of his profound effect on subsequent Christian thought, he is often called the "Father of Modern Liberal Theology" and is considered an early leader in liberal Christianity. The Neo-Orthodoxy movement of the twentieth century, typically (though not without challenge) seen to be spearheaded by Karl Barth, was in many ways an attempt to challenge his influence.

--

(*Anthony Wallace*)

Religion is a **set of rituals, rationalized by myth**, which mobilizes supernatural powers for the purpose of achieving or preventing transformations of state in man or nature .

Note:
(April 15, 1923 - October 5, 2015) was a Canadian-American anthropologist who specialized in Native American cultures, especially the Iroquois. His research expressed an interest in the intersection of cultural anthropology and psychology. He was famous for the theory of revitalization movements.[1]

--

(Emile *Durkheim*)

Religion is only **the sentiment inspired by the group in its members**, but projected outside of the consciousness that experiences them, and objectified .

Note:
April 15, 1858 – November 15, 1917) was a French sociologist, social psychologist and philosopher. He formally established the academic discipline and—with Karl Marx and Max Weber—is commonly cited as the principal architect of modern social science and father of sociology.[2][3]

--


(James G. *Frazer*)

Religion is a propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man which are believed to direct and control the course of Nature and of human life .

**Other possible definitions?**

Note:
1 January 1854 – 7 May 1941), was a Scottish social anthropologist influential in the early stages of the modern studies of mythology and comparative religion.[2] He is often considered one of the founding fathers of modern anthropology.

His most famous work, The Golden Bough (1890), documents and details the similarities among magical and religious beliefs around the globe. Frazer posited that human belief progressed through three stages: primitive magic, replaced by religion, in turn replaced by science

(*William James*)

The very fact that there are so many (definitions of religion) … is enough to prove that the word “religion” cannot stand for any single principle or essence, but is rather a collective name …

## A Definition of Religion

**cautious, recognizing that we cannot escape our own perspective** ... 
------------------
The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the "religious" from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.

## What's it made of?

## Elements of Religion

- Human thought
- Feeling
- Action
- Social interconnectedness
- Values
--

### Religion and Human Thought
Religion is intimately connected with human thought.
<li class="fragment">Even those who focus on practice have beliefs, develop doctrines, and emphasize the importance of certain teachings in the religious life essential to their way of life.</li>

--


### Religion and Feeling
To some extent, all religious experience is an emotional experience.
<li class="fragment">Friedrich Schleiermacher characterized religion as a feeling of absolute dependence. </li>
<li class="fragment">Rudolf Otto, characterized religion as the experience of the holy. And this experience is one that inspires feelings of fear, awe, terror, and love. </li>

--


### Religion and Action
While the form and place of religious action vary, the importance of action to an understanding of religion is evident.
 Examples of religious action:

<li class="fragment"> 1. Islam = the duty of prayer and *salat*</li>
<li class="fragment">2. Shinto = approach the shrine of kami by washing, ringing a bell, and clapping their handsa </li>
<li class="fragment">3. Roman Catholicism =  attend mass </li>

--



### Individual and Social Existence
*Most of the great religions make a place for individual devotion and encourage persons to search for union with the ultimate reality.**

But we must be careful not to overstress the individual dimension of religion.
<li class="fragment">- One of the most elementary components of religion is some emphasis on the idea of society. </li>
<li class="fragment">- Thus, the essence of religion is the ways in which it enables individual persons to identify with the values associated with a particular group. </li>

--


### Values and Religion
In most times and places, religion has been closely connected with morality.
<li class="fragment">- To some, religion confirms the moral law and gives one power to perform one's duty. </li>
<li class="fragment">- Religion is a way of expressing important societal values. </li>

<li class="fragment">For example, when believers in various settings pray or offer sacrifices to honor God, or to ward off spirits that threaten tribal unity, they express their sense of what is important in life.
 </li>

## What kind of stuff? : Substance or Function?

### Functionalist Definition of Religion
- Focuses on the role religion plays in the lives of persons and groups.
- Might focus on the ways religion enables people to sustain hope in the face of difficult circumstances.
- “Functionalist” understands **religion** to have to with the role it plays ordering, making sense, of human existence

--

### Substantive Definition of Religion
- Attempts to limit the phenomena that may be characterized as religious.
- Seeks to identify what it is that makes certain responses to death and suffering religious and others not.
- “Substantive” recognizes that **religion** is to be contrasted with the many other … isms or ways of thought etc. that function to make life bearable, ordered, etc. (cf. Martineau's definition above)

--

### Definition must be both

- Considerations of function are necessary but not sufficient to the task of defining religion.
- But an adequate definition of religion must include a substantive component.
- Thus, **any adequate definition of religion must account for both the function and substance of religion.**

1. Religion and politics overlap but are not the same
2. Religion and morality overlap but are not the same
3. religion and science overlap but are not the same
4. … history?

---

## A Proposed Definition

--

### Religion signifies those ways of viewing the world that refer to:

1. a notion of sacred reality
2. made manifest in human experience
3. in such a way as to produce long-lasting ways of thinking, feeling, and acting
4. with respect to problems of ordering and understanding existence

---


### A Notion of Sacred Reality

- A **notion of sacred reality establishes a boundary between religion and non-religion.**
- **Sacred** indicates a reality that is somehow distinct, set apart, other than **ordinary**.
- Sacred reality includes the God of the **Bible**, the **Qur'anic Allah**, the **Brahman** of Hinduism, Buddhism's **Nirvana**, the **kami** of Shinto.

--


## Manifest in Human Experience

- Although the sacred is set apart from the ordinary, it nevertheless may be experienced, thought about, and acted upon.
- Thus, all religion has to do with the element of the **sacred manifesting itself in various ways**: in rituals, persons, and natural phenomena. 

-----------------

1. Muslims = the sacred reality (**Allah**) is made manifest through prophecy
2. Buddhists = the goal of **Nirvana** comes to life in the life and teaching of the Buddha
3. Navaho = the story of the Navaho people makes wisdom available for those who seek harmony between all things.

--


## Long-Lasting Ways of Thinking and Feeling

- Religious ways develop over time.  And they come to constitute traditions that may be identified with the history of particular communities.
- For example, the prophecy of Muhammad is the beginning of the tradition of Islam.

	- Islam's message and the story of its revelation in seventh-century Arabia have produced characteristic modes of thought, feeling, and action among a large percentage of the world's population.

--


## Ordering and Understanding Existence

- Stresses the way in which notions of sacred reality are related to problems of suffering and death.
- Also stresses the way in which notions of sacred reality are related to other problems; such as the ordering of political or economic life.
