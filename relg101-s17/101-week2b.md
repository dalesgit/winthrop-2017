## Possible Definitions of Religion

(James Martineau)

Religion is the belief in an ever living God, that is, in a Divine Mind and Will ruling the Universe and holding moral relations with mankind .

Note:
21 April 1805 – 11 January 1900) was an English religious philosopher influential in the history of Unitarianism.

Religion is the feeling of absolute dependence or the consciousness that the whole of our spontaneous activity comes from a source outside of us .

Note: 
November 21, 1768 – February 12, 1834) was a German theologian, philosopher, and biblical scholar known for his attempt to reconcile the criticisms of the Enlightenment with traditional Protestant Christianity. He also became influential in the evolution of Higher Criticism, and his work forms part of the foundation of the modern field of hermeneutics. Because of his profound effect on subsequent Christian thought, he is often called the "Father of Modern Liberal Theology" and is considered an early leader in liberal Christianity. The Neo-Orthodoxy movement of the twentieth century, typically (though not without challenge) seen to be spearheaded by Karl Barth, was in many ways an attempt to challenge his influence.

(Anthony Wallace)

Religion is a set of rituals, rationalized by myth, which mobilizes supernatural powers for the purpose of achieving or preventing transformations of state in man or nature .

**Other possible definitions?**

Note:
1 January 1854 – 7 May 1941), was a Scottish social anthropologist influential in the early stages of the modern studies of mythology and comparative religion.[2] He is often considered one of the founding fathers of modern anthropology.

His most famous work, The Golden Bough (1890), documents and details the similarities among magical and religious beliefs around the globe. Frazer posited that human belief progressed through three stages: primitive magic, replaced by religion, in turn replaced by science

## A Definition of Religion<a id="sec-1-1" name="sec-1-1"></a>
**cautious, recognizing our own perspective** ...
------------------
The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the "religious" from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.

## Elements of Religion

### Religion and Human Thought
- Religion is intimately connected with human thought.
- Even those who focus on practice have beliefs, develop doctrines, and emphasize the importance of certain teachings in the religious life essential to their way of life.

--


### Religion and Feeling
- To some extent, all religious experience is an emotional experience.
- Friedrich Schleiermacher characterized religion as a feeling of absolute dependence.
- Rudolf Otto, characterized religion as the experience of the holy. And this experience is one that inspires feelings of fear, awe, terror, and love.

--


### Religion and Action
- While the form and place of religious action vary, the importance of action to an understanding of religion is evident.
- Examples of religious action:

1. Islam = the duty of prayer and salat
2. Shinto = approach the shrine of kami by washing, ringing a bell, and clapping their hands
3. Roman Catholicism =  attend mass

--



### Individual and Social Existence
*Most of the great religions make a place for individual devotion and encourage persons to search for union with the ultimate reality.**

- But we must be careful not to overstress the individual dimension of religion.
- One of the most elementary components of religion is some emphasis on the idea of society.
- Thus, the essence of religion is the ways in which it enables individual persons to identify with the values associated with a particular group.

--


### Values and Religion
- In most times and places, religion has been closely connected with morality.
- To some, religion confirms the moral law and gives one power to perform one's duty.
- Religion is a way of expressing important societal values.

<li class="fragment">For example, when believers in various settings pray or offer sacrifices to honor God, or to ward off spirits that threaten tribal unity, they express their sense of what is important in life.

## What kind of stuff? : Substance or Function?

### Functionalist Definition of Religion
- Focuses on the role religion plays in the lives of persons and groups.
- Might focus on the ways religion enables people to sustain hope in the face of difficult circumstances.

--

### Substantive Definition of Religion
- Attempts to limit the phenomena that may be characterized as religious.
- Seeks to identify what it is that makes certain responses to death and suffering religious and others not.

--

### Definition must be both

- Considerations of function are necessary but not sufficient to the task of defining religion.
- But an adequate definition of religion must include a substantive component.
- Thus, **any adequate definition of religion must account for both the function and substance of religion.**

--

## A Proposed Definition<a id="sec-1-4" name="sec-1-4"></a>


### Religion signifies those ways of viewing the world that refer to:

1. a notion of sacred reality
2. made manifest in human experience
3. in such a way as to produce long-lasting ways of thinking, feeling, and acting
4. with respect to problems of ordering and understanding existence

---


## A Notion of Sacred Reality

- A notion of sacred reality establishes a boundary between religion and non-religion.
- Sacred indicates a reality that is somehow distinct, set apart, other than ordinary.
- Sacred reality includes the God of the Bible, the Qur'anic Allah, the Brahman of Hinduism, Buddhism's Nirvana, the kami of Shinto.

--


## Manifest in Human Experience

- Although the sacred is set apart from the ordinary, it nevertheless may be experienced, thought about, and acted upon.
- Thus, all religion has to do with the element of the sacred manifesting itself in various ways: in rituals, persons, and natural phenomena. 

-----------------

1. Muslims = the sacred reality (Allah) is made manifest through prophecy
2. Buddhists = the goal of Nirvana comes to life in the life and teaching of the Buddha
3. Navaho = the story of the Navaho people makes wisdom available for those who seek harmony between all things.

--


## Long-Lasting Ways of Thinking and Feeling

- Religious ways develop over time.  And they come to constitute traditions that may be identified with the history of particular communities.

--

For example, the prophecy of Muhammad is the beginning of the tradition of Islam.

1. Islam's message and the story of its revelation in seventh-century Arabia have produced characteristic modes of thought, feeling, and action among a large percentage of the world's population.

--


## Ordering and Understanding Existence

- Stresses the way in which notions of sacred reality are related to problems of suffering and death.
- Also stresses the way in which notions of sacred reality are related to other problems; such as the ordering of political or economic life.

## Some examples from your journals

As a child, I went to Catholic School. I never questioned some of the things that I have read about in the first two chapters of The Sacred Quest. I have always accepted the definition of religion that I was taught as a young child up until now. I realize now that religion can never really be put into a box and summarized by one sentence. As for chapter two, sacred things and places were things that I thought were only connected to religious things or holy practices. It made me question what exactly could be classified as sacred, and then go on to question what made those places or things sacred in the f
