##  Tools Used in the Study Religion

-   Textual: study sacred texts
-   Historical: describe origin and development of specific religions
-   Comparative: compare specific types of religious behaviors, beliefs
-   Philosophical: philosophical analysis of religious language and arguments
-   Intellectual & Social History: trace development of religious ideas and institutions over time

##  Phenomenological Method draws upon all five tools and consists of four steps:

-   Gathering Data: observe and describe religious behaviors, speech, beliefs, etc. from the point of view of religious persons and seeking to identify and understand their intentions by
-   Search for Patterns: look for common patterns across different religions and religious experiences.
-   Analysis of Patterns (for their structures): look for universal meanings in patterns that transcend particular religious contexts and recognize diverse meanings (lack of universal meanings)
-   Offer Generalizations about religious patterns and about religion itself. Describe the common forms and elements of religious life and may even take the next step to offer theory or general explanation of the meaning of these patterns and the nature of religion.
